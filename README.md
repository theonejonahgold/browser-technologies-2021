## The three layers of progressive enhancement

1. All basic content is displayed in semantic HTML. The quiz flow is kept up-to-date with frequent page refreshes, which might be a bit jarring, but all moments where user input is required are not automatically refreshed to make the experience more bearable.
2. With CSS I bring more hierarchy to the content. The content is usable by itself, but the CSS just gives the content the extra push it needs to be fully usable.
3. With JS I take interactivity to a whole new level. Using Web Sockets and template tags I have made sure to streamline the quiz flow, creating and editing questions, and more!

A list of all the enhancements I've put in place are found below.

### List of all enhancements

- CSS Grid layouts, built upon working flexbox layouts.
- A proper countdown with CSS animations, instead of the numbers "3", "2" and "1" statically displayed on the screen.
- Deletion confirmations with `confirm()`.
- "Add answer" creating a new answer input instead of submitting the form and thus refreshing the page.
- Web Sockets when hosting or joining a quiz, streamlining the experience and making it snappier for all parties.
